fix: Distinguish 403 authorization errors from WAF blocks (v0.5.38)

PROBLEM:
- 403 'you do not have access to that model' errors were being
  incorrectly treated as CloudFront WAF blocks
- This caused unnecessary retries and misleading CloudFrontWAFError
- Real issue was API key lacking model access, not content blocking

FIX:
- Enhanced _is_cloudfront_403() to check for authorization indicators
- Now excludes errors containing:
  - 'you do not have access to that model'
  - 'authorization_error'
  - 'invalid api key' / 'invalid_api_key'
  - 'unauthorized' / 'authentication'
- Only generic 403/forbidden errors are treated as WAF blocks

TESTS:
- Added test_403_model_authorization_error_not_treated_as_waf
- Added test_403_api_key_error_not_treated_as_waf
- Added test_403_generic_forbidden_treated_as_waf
- All 494 tests passing
